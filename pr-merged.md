### For github pages users,
* Go to your github page repo (`user/user.github.io`)
* Open up the **settings** tab
* Scroll down to the **Github pages** section
* In the **Custom domain** text input, enter the domain you registered (`domain-name.is-a.dev`)
* Check the **Enforce HTTPS** checkbox below the input
* Give it some time to reflect and you should be good to go
