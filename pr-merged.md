### Server Owners
If your domain points to a server you own, add your-domain.is-a.dev to your domain configuration. For HTTPS, you will have to configure an SSL certificate to allow the new subdomain to work ([here's why](https://get.dev/#:~:text=The%20.dev%20top%2Dlevel%20domain%20is%20included%20on%20the%20HSTS%20preload%20list%2C%20making%20HTTPS%20required%20on%20all%20connections%20to%20.dev%20websites%20and%20pages%20without%20needing%20individual%20HSTS%20registration%20or%20configuration.%20Security%20is%20built%20in.)).

### GitHub Pages
- Go to your GitHub repository that you use for your is-a.dev domain
- Click on the Settings tab
- Click on the Pages link in the sidebar
- In the custom domain option, enter the domain you registered.
- Check the `Enforce HTTPS` checkbox
- Give your domain some time (~24 hours) for the changes to propagate
- Enjoy your domain!
